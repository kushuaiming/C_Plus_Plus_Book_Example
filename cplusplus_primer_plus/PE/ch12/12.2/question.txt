Enhance the String class declaration (that is, upgrade string1.h to string2.h ) by doing the following:
a. Overload the + operator to allow you to join two strings into one.
b. Provide a stringlow() member function that converts all alphabetic characters in a string to lowercase. (Donâ€™t forget the cctype family of character functions.)
c. Provide a stringup() member function that converts all alphabetic characters in a string to uppercase.
d. Provide a member function that takes a char argument and returns the number of times the character appears in the string.
Test your work in the following program:
(It's pe12_2.cpp)
Your output should look like this sample run:
Please enter your name: Fretta Farbo
My name is Fretta Farbo.
The string
MY NAME IS FRETTA FARBO AND I AM A C++ STUDENT.
contains 6 'A' characters in it.
Enter the name of a primary color for mixing light: yellow
Try again!
BLUE
That's right!
Bye
