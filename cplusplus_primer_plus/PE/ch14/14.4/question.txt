A Person class holds the first name and the last name of a person. In addition to its constructors, it has a Show() method that displays both names.A Gunslinger class derives virtually from the Person class. It has a Draw() member that returns a type double value representing a gunslinger’s draw time.The class also has an int member representing the number of notches on a gunslinger’s gun. Finally, it has a Show() function that displays all this information.
A PokerPlayer class derives virtually from the Person class. It has a Draw() member that returns a random number in the range 1 through 52, representing a card value. (Optionally, you could define a Card class with suit and face value members and use a Card return value for Draw() .) The PokerPlayer class uses the Person show() function.The BadDude class derives publicly from the Gunslinger and PokerPlayer classes. It has a Gdraw() member that returns a bad dude’s draw time and a Cdraw() member that returns the next card drawn. It has an appropriate Show() function. Define all these classes and methods, along with any other necessary methods (such as methods for setting object values) and test them in a simple program similar to that in Listing 14.12.
