Start with the following class declaration:
// base class
class Cd { // represents a CD disk
private:
    char performers[50];
    char label[20];
    int selections;     // number of selections
    double playtime;    // playing time in minutes
public:
    Cd(char * s1, char * s2, int n, double x);
    Cd(const Cd & d);
    Cd();
    ~Cd();
    void Report() const; // reports all CD data
    Cd & operator=(const Cd & d);
};

Derive a Classic class that adds an array of char members that will hold a string identifying the primary work on the CD. If the base class requires that any functions be virtual, modify the base-class declaration to make it so. If a declared method is not needed, remove it from the definition.Test your product with the following program:
(It's useclassic.cpp)
