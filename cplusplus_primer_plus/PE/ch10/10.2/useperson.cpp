 * Here is a rather simple class definition:

 * (It uses both a string object and a character array so that you can
 * compare how the two forms are used.) Write a program that completes the
 * implementation by providing code for the undefined methods.The program
 * in which you use the class should also use the three possible
 * constructor calls (no arguments, one argument, and two arguments) and
 * the two display methods. Hereâ€™s an example that uses the constructors
 * and methods:
 * (And that's this file.)
